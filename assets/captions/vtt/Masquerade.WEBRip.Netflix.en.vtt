00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
IN HIS 8TH YEAR OF REIGN.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.000
AS RUMORS OF TREASON FILL THE COURT.
KING KWANGHAE SECRETLY COMMANDS

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:15.000
"FIND A MAN WITH MY RESEMBLANCE

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:25.000
HE SHALL STAY
IN THE ROYAL CHAMBER AFTER SUNSET

5
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.679

SHALL BE REMOVED FROM THE GAZETTE"

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.640
JOURNALS OF KING GWANGHAE
FEB 28. 1616

7
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.140
Drink it.

8
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.576
I said drink.

9
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.625
What are you waiting for?

10
00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.711
Punish me with death. Your Majesty.

11
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.546
-Punish us with death.
-Punish us with death.

12
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.465
Chief Royal Secretary to see His Majesty.

13
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.972
What happened?

14
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.309
Th silver spoon has turned black.

15
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.231
I shall have my bedchamber moved at once.

16
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.941
Your Majesty.

17
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.487
You must hold your ground
especially at a time like this.

18
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.615
Is that all you have to say?

19
00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.245
What would please your enemies more
than to see you abandon your quarters?

20
00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:49.622
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.

21
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.214
Approach me.

22
00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.427
Leave us.

23
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.900
Have you found one?

24
00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.113
Forgive me. sire but…

25
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.617
Make haste.

26
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.620
He must look exactly like me.

27
00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.544
I cannot trust anyone.

28
00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.009
No one.

29
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:50.266
-I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
-I beg Your Majesty to take heed.

30
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.936
-I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
-I beg Your Majesty to take heed.

31
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:58.524
Don't you hear the cries of the scholars?

32
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.944
I beg you to allow
an inquisition of Yu Jeong-ho.

33
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.655
-We beg of Your Majesty.
-We beg of Your Majesty.

34
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.240
No. Your Majesty.

35
00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.077
If you allow
inquisitions based on hearsay.

36
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.496
there'll be a flood
of unjustified accusations.

37
00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.915
giving rise to great disarray.

38
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.958
You are crossing the line.
Chief Secretary.

39
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.045
How dare you dismiss
the advice of the king's loyal servants?

40
00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:20.755
It worries me
that you're only after rumors

41
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:23.508
while there are more urgent
and outstanding state affairs.

42
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.386
What is more urgent than treason?

43
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.640
Your Majesty.
Yu Jeong-ho must be put to death at once.

44
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.225
No. Your Majesty.

45
00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.436
Punishment can wait
until right and wrong has been determined.

46
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.480
Yu Jeong-ho is a dangerous man.

47
00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.607
Give us a royal command. Your Majesty.

48
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.735
-Your command. Your Majesty.
-Your command. Your Majesty.

49
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:50.243
His Majesty the King!

50
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.064
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

51
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:24.068
Yu is a heretic
who rejects orthodox teachings.

52
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:27.238
Retribution for his crime
must not be delayed.

53
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.867
-We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
-We beg Your Majesty to take heed.

54
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.161
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.

55
00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:37.915
Tread on our backs if you must.

56
00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:44.297
-We beg of Your Majesty.
-We beg of Your Majesty.

57
00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:47.341
This time.

58
00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:50.720
they will really have my brother beheaded.

59
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.054
Madam.

60
00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.061
This madness will only end

61
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.898
upon my own death.

62
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.319
His Majesty the King!

63
00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.779
The king climbs
over the wall and opens the door

64
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:12.033
and asks for Hong-jin.

65
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.620
Hong-jin.

66
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:18.748
Where are you. my dear?

67
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.543
Gotcha! You're hiding here.

68
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.838
Come on out. Come on out of there.

69
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.341
There you go!

70
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.264
Oh my. Let's see.

71
00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:41.020
Oh my. Aren't you voluptuous?

72
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.314
You're in luck tonight.

73
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:44.690
My gosh!

74
00:08:57.578 --> 00:09:02.959
"Your Majesty.
You call upon me without notice again.

75
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.838
If you keep doing this.
I fear it will be the death of me."

76
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.758
-All right!
-Come here. whore.

77
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.847
The king takes her soft hand

78
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.475
and pulls her deep into the court.

79
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.811
-All right!
-He reaches for her undergarment.

80
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.984
And her ample derriere rubs
against his royal body.

81
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.485
All right!

82
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.655
-The king smiles happily.
-Oh my!

83
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.824
Then. once on the left!

84
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.617
Once on the right!

85
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.619
And flips her over for some more!

86
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.123
Watching the sunrise in the east.

87
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:44.166
-Oh my!
-Bang!

88
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.960
Watching the sunset in the west.

89
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:48.087
Bang!

90
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.966
Bang here and bang there!

91
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:56.846
-All night long!
-Bang!

92
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.779
Take off the cover.

93
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:19.869
Sir.

94
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.787
The king involving himself

95
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.416
with the court ladies
is such an absurd idea.

96
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:29.128
Something like that
can never happen in real life.

97
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.547
And that's what makes it so interesting.

98
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.090
-Help him up.
-I'm sorry?

99
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.315
With all due respect. sir. Who are you?

100
00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.573
Listen to me carefully.

101
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:03.412
In a moment.
you shall have an audience with the king.

102
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.290
Sir?

103
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.669
When His Majesty asks you a question.
respond with "Yes. Your Majesty."

104
00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.712
When a longer answer is required.

105
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.674
you must answer by saying
"If it pleases Your Majesty."

106
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.053
You must not ask questions
or look upon his face.

107
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:20.971
Do you understand?

108
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.935
Make him presentable to the king.

109
00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.491
Wretch.

110
00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.272
Lift your head.

111
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:13.709
Repeat what I say.

112
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.045
"Is anyone there?"

113
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.839
Yes. Your Majesty.

114
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:21.133
I said repeat.

115
00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.638
-Yes. Your Majesty.
-Insufferable wretch!

116
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.474
Is that all you have to say?

117
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:40.611
If it pleases Your Majesty.

118
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:00.631
"Repeat what I say.

119
00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:03.259
Is anyone there?

120
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.471
I said repeat.

121
00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.185
Insufferable wretch!

122
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.647
Is that all you have to say?"

123
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:29.869
Not bad indeed.

124
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.123
He performs masked farce
at a courtesans' house.

125
00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.041
As he has basic knowledge
of Chinese characters.

126
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.127
I presume he is not of the lowest birth.

127
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.409
Oh. my legs.

128
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.114
"Repeat what I say.

129
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:51.909
Is anyone there?"

130
00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:56.747
Yes. Your Majesty.

131
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.626
Would you care for a night snack?

132
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:03.545
All right.

133
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.839
Yes. Your Majesty.

134
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.184
Have a night snack brought in.

135
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:21.230
Have plenty brought in.

136
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.327
You scared me.

137
00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.561
Calling upon me so frequently
will upset the queen.

138
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.647
Will it not?

139
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.734
What choice do I have?

140
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.071
I only sleep soundly next to you.

141
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:05.042
Get up.

142
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.716
Sir.

143
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.052
You can go now.

144
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.572
Once every three nights.
when the curfew bell sounds.

145
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:39.076
wait by the west palace gate.
Don't be late.

146
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:46.792
You shall not speak
of anything about tonight.

147
00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.170
You found the right man.

148
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.974
Follow me looking at my heels only.

149
00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.030
Be careful.

150
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.622
Three!

151
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.833
Spare me. my lord.

152
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:32.004
He was charged
with telling of lewd stories.

153
00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:36.216
I beg of you.
I never knew it constituted a crime.

154
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.426
I'm telling the truth.

155
00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:41.096
The gentry talk
of far more lewd things. do they not?

156
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.723
Who are you comparing yourself to?

157
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:46.101
-Four!
-Four!

158
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:50.189
Whoever it was that ratted me out.
I shall kill the wretched bastard.

159
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.441
-Five!
-Five!

160
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.401
Hold it.

161
00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:00.490
Does it hurt?

162
00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.409
Spare me. my lord.

163
00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:06.538
I hear about a new young courtesan
who just arrived at Honglu.

164
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.541
How about it? Her in exchange for this.

165
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:14.213
But it's not up to me to decide.

166
00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.007
-My lord.
-Hit the shit out of him!

167
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.509
Save me. my lord!

168
00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.279
Take all the time you need. miss.

169
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.742
Did you say you were from Jeonju?

170
00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.244
Yes.

171
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.080
How old are you?

172
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.959
Fifteen.

173
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:03.929
I am terribly sorry.

174
00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.767
I miss my mama.

175
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.445
Not a single chick was killed.

176
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:22.823
If arsenic was present.

177
00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:26.159
even in the smallest dose.
it would have killed the chicks.

178
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.331
If it wasn't poison.
what turned the spoon black?

179
00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:37.421
Recently. they started using
bamboo salt to season the king's food.

180
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:44.761
Bamboo salt?

181
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.763
Yes. Your Majesty.

182
00:21:47.597 --> 00:21:51.435
The iron found in bamboo salt
changed the color of the spoon.

183
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:58.900
I implore you. sire.
and I offer my head to say this.

184
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.612
If this is about Yu.
I shall not hear more of it.

185
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:03.989
Forgive me. Your Majesty.

186
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.367
but Yu Jeong-ho
would never plot treason against you.

187
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.285
Enough.

188
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.913
I know it. too.

189
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.669
Yu is my loyal servant

190
00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:21.340
and trusted brother-in-law.

191
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.010
But I'll need to sacrifice someone like Yu

192
00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.972
in order to gain their trust.

193
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.609
Sir. the royal physician sent for you.

194
00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:01.963
Come this way.

195
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.941
It appears that he's been poisoned.

196
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:23.902
Will he recover?

197
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.448
Forgive me.

198
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:33.995
but I cannot confirm
anything at this point.

199
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:38.625
We may need to prepare
for a national calamity.

200
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.379
Who else knows about this?

201
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:48.468
So far. only myself and Chief Eunuch.

202
00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:59.813
I shall take full responsibility
for what I'm about to say.

203
00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:04.109
Both you and Chief Eunuch
shall remain silent

204
00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:06.319
about His Majesty's condition.

205
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:07.988
But. sir.

206
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:09.448
You know better than anyone

207
00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.077
that you will not live
if the king passes away.

208
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.957
If the word about this gets out.

209
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.794
the court will fall
into unimaginable chaos.

210
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:27.966
That is clearly
what the conspirator wanted.

211
00:24:30.343 --> 00:24:34.973
<i>The king is bedridden because of a cold.</i>

212
00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:40.645
<i>Please wake Captain Do</i>
<i>and fetch the jester at once.</i>

213
00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:44.900
<i>Take His Majesty to a remote temple.</i>

214
00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:48.904
<i>Absolutely no one is to know about this</i>

215
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:53.742
<i>until the poison is identified</i>
<i>and His Majesty recovers.</i>

216
00:24:56.786 --> 00:24:58.830
It's not the night we've arranged for.

217
00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:01.875
The king must be going somewhere nice.

218
00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.670
I see the beating
didn't teach you anything.

219
00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:10.675
I beg your pardon?

220
00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.887
Was it you that ratted me out?
